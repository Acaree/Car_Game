# The Long Road # By: Alex Campamar and Sergio Gómez.

# Welcome to this circuit that haves a lot of curves and multiple obstacles. You have to do 3 laps in the less than 7,5 minutes (450 seconds) if not, you will return to the finish line from the begining (yes, in the first lap with time 0), there are checkpoints during the circuit in case you fall or if you get stuck. Good luck!

# Controls
Up/down arrows -> move forward/backwards
Right/Left -> turn right/left
Right control -> respawn to the latest checkpoint (situed on red flags)
P -> for start/pause the game
M -> add one lap (use this if you want to restart the game if you dont want to do the three laps, dont cheat >:( )
Right mouse click -> you can move the camera around the car if u want to see the map (do not recommend doing this while you are driving).

To delete the previous best time you should go into the exe folder and delete the file "save_game.xml"
